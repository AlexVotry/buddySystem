      <p>This app is designed to allow people to venture out to places they want to go, and have a couple people there to spend the time with.</p>
      <p>This is not a dating app.  We don't ask questions about your personality or marital status.</p>
      <p>We do ask for a photo so people will recognize you, and event interests to provide you with events you care about.</p>
      <p>We want people to be reliable, so after the event you can fill out a four-question survey that is mostly whether the person actually showed up.</p>
