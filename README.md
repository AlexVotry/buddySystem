### This is not a dating app.

This app is designed to allow people who want to go to an event or just do somethiing, find someone or some people to do it with.  The idea is to allow a user to post an event and how many people they'd like to join them, and let other members decide if they want to join.

## Available Scripts

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. This uses `concurrently` to start the nodejs server and the React server at the same time.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
